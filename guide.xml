    <desc lang="en">The Guests from Loughborough eat a diet of convenience food that is not only unwholesome, it is also very expensive. Mum Lisa is aware she has to make her family more healthy, but is going about it the wrong way, buying into costly `superfoods' rather than good old-fashioned fruit and veg. Can Gregg and Chris help the Guests bring more variety to their plates - and in turn, knock a whopping 50 per cent off their shopping bill? Along the way, they also investigate how canned fish compares to fresh and which oil is best for cooking, as well as the diet cons to watch out for. Last in the series.</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Argentina v Tonga</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Argentina v Tonga (Kick-off 2.30pm). Coverage of the Pool C encounter from Leicester City Stadium, as the teams face each other for the first time in their history. The Pumas will expect to record a victory in this match, and also claim one of the top two positions in the pool that guarantees a place in the quarter-finals, while Tonga will likely battle for third place and an automatic spot in the 2019 World Cup. Argentina's best-ever performance at a World Cup came in 2007 when they went on to finish third, and they have reached the knockout stage on three occasions in total, whereas Tonga have never made it beyond the pool stage. Presented by John Inverdale, with analysis from Brian O'Driscoll, Lawrence Dallaglio and George Gregan, and commentary by Martin Gillingham and Shane Williams.</desc>

This is only the second-ever World Cup fixture between these nations, with the previous one having taken place at the 2011 tournament in New Zealand. That was also a pool-stage match, and Ireland's comprehensive 36-6 victory at Otago Stadium in Dunedin ensured they would top Pool C having won all four of their games, though their subsequent quarter-final match against Wales saw their run come to an end as they lost 22-10. Presented by John Inverdale, with analysis from Brian O'Driscoll, Lawrence Dallaglio and George Gregan, and commentary by Jon Champion, Geordan Murphy and Ben Kay.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The first stage of this year's three-part Six Chair Challenge arrives, in which judges Simon Cowell, Rita Ora, Nick Grimshaw and Cheryl Fernandez-Versini are given the opportunity to pick six acts to champion through to the later stages of the contest. The format has the potential to generate a great deal of drama in the studio, as the judges have the right to switch acts in and out of their line-up whenever they choose. Girl group 4th Power, 17-year-old singer Louisa Johnson and youth worker Monica Michael are among the would-be stars who have already secured a place in this round of the contest, but it remains to be seen whether any of them will be able to win over the panel and progress further.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Argentina v Tonga (Kick-off 2.30pm). Coverage of the Pool C encounter from Leicester City Stadium, as the teams face each other for the first time in their history. The Pumas will expect to record a victory in this match, and also claim one of the top two positions in the pool that guarantees a place in the quarter-finals, while Tonga will likely battle for third place and an automatic spot in the 2019 World Cup. Argentina's best-ever performance at a World Cup came in 2007 when they went on to finish third, and they have reached the knockout stage on three occasions in total, whereas Tonga have never made it beyond the pool stage. Presented by John Inverdale, with analysis from Brian O'Driscoll, Lawrence Dallaglio and George Gregan, and commentary by Martin Gillingham and Shane Williams.</desc>

This is only the second-ever World Cup fixture between these nations, with the previous one having taken place at the 2011 tournament in New Zealand. That was also a pool-stage match, and Ireland's comprehensive 36-6 victory at Otago Stadium in Dunedin ensured they would top Pool C having won all four of their games, though their subsequent quarter-final match against Wales saw their run come to an end as they lost 22-10.

    <desc lang="en">The first stage of this year's three-part Six Chair Challenge arrives, in which judges Simon Cowell, Rita Ora, Nick Grimshaw and Cheryl Fernandez-Versini are given the opportunity to pick six acts to champion through to the later stages of the contest. The format has the potential to generate a great deal of drama in the studio, as the judges have the right to switch acts in and out of their line-up whenever they choose. Girl group 4th Power, 17-year-old singer Louisa Johnson and youth worker Monica Michael are among the would-be stars who have already secured a place in this round of the contest, but it remains to be seen whether any of them will be able to win over the panel and progress further.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">An insight into the pioneering work of criminal lawyer-turned-archaeologist Dr Kathleen Martinez, who has made it her life's mission to locate the final resting place of Cleopatra, Egypt's last queen. Despite centuries of searching, very little evidence of the location of Cleopatra's tomb has ever been uncovered, but Kathleen's radical new theory on the queen's identity has led her to search where no-one else dared. Her hunch stunned the archaeological establishment as she uncovered a hidden network of tunnels and a vast city of the dead, as well as a 35-metre deep underground hole that bears all the hallmarks of a burial shaft.</desc>

    <title lang="en">Asian Provocateur</title>
    <desc lang="en">Comedian Romesh Ranganathan considers himself British through and through. He grew up in Horsham, doesn't speak a word of Tamil, doesn't know any of his relatives, has no idea about his cultural heritage and has almost zero desire to go to Sri Lanka. Like thousands of other British children of immigrants, he knows very little about the land where his parents came from. As his mother Shanti says - he's a coconut. Sri Lankan on the outside but British on the inside. Now Shanti wants her son to connect to his roots - so she has decided to change all that by sending Romesh on an odyssey around the motherland. Not that he's that happy about it. (BBC Three/filmon.com)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Joy Division</title>
    <desc lang="en">On June 4 1976, four young men from ruined, post-industrial Manchester went to see a Sex Pistols show at the Manchester Lesser Free Trade Hall. Inspired by the gig that is now credited with igniting the Manchester music scene, they formed what was to become one of the world's most influential bands, Joy Division. Over thirty years later, despite a tragedy that was to cut them off in their prime, they are enjoying a larger audience and more influence than ever before, with a profound legacy that resonates fiercely in today's heavily manufactured pop culture. Featuring the participation of all the surviving band members, this film examines the band's story through never-before-seen live performance footage, personal photos, period films and newly discovered audiotapes. A fresh visual account of a unique time and place, this is the untold story of how four men transcended economic and cultural barriers to produce an enduring musical legacy, at a time of great social and political change.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Professor Andrew Wallace-Hadrill presents a documentary following the scientific investigation that aims to lift the lid on what life was like in the small Roman town of Herculaneum, moments before it was destroyed by a volcanic eruption. The investigation, based around the discovery of 12 arched vaults, reveals in great detail the lives of the ill-fated town's residents, and unique aerial photography gives a behind-the-scenes look at the town from the skies. With contributions from the forensic scientists leading the investigation, the film uncovers the minutiae of daily life in Herculaneum, including not just what residents ate but how they ate it, and why most of the skeletons found on the coast were men and those in the vaults, women and children.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Professor Alice Roberts reveals the natural history of one the most famous of ice age animals - the woolly mammoth. Mammoths have transfixed humans since the depths of the last ice age, when their herds roamed across what is now Europe and Asia. Although these curious members of the elephant family have now been extinct for thousands of years, scientists can now paint an incredibly detailed picture of their lives thanks to whole carcasses that have been beautifully preserved in the Siberian permafrost. Alice meets scientists who are using the latest genetic, chemical and molecular tests to reveal the adaptations that allowed mammoths to evolve from their origins in the tropics to surviving the extremes of Siberia. In a dramatic end to the film, she helps unveil a brand new woolly mammoth carcass that may shed new light on our own ancestors' role in their extinction.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Argentina v Tonga (Kick-off 2.30pm). Coverage of the first-half of the Pool C clash from Leicester City Stadium, as the teams face each other for the first time in their history. The Pumas will expect to record a victory in this match, and also claim one of the top two positions in the pool that guarantees a place in the quarter-finals, while Tonga will likely battle for third place and an automatic spot in the 2019 World Cup. Argentina's best-ever performance at a World Cup came in 2007 when they went on to finish third, and they have reached the knockout stage on three occasions in total, whereas Tonga have never made it beyond the pool stage. Presented by Matt Cooper, with commentary by Tony Johnson and Joel Stransky, and analysis from Keith Wood, Matt Williams and Peter Stringer. Coverage of the second-half will be on 3e.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Ireland v Italy (Kick-off 4.45pm). Coverage of the third Pool D match for both teams, which takes place at the Olympic Stadium in London. This is only the second-ever World Cup fixture between these nations, with the previous one having taken place at the 2011 tournament in New Zealand. That was also a pool-stage match, and Ireland's comprehensive 36-6 victory at Otago Stadium in Dunedin ensured they would top Pool C having won all four of their games, though their subsequent quarter-final match against Wales saw their run come to an end as they lost 22-10. Presented by Matt Cooper, with commentary by Conor McNamara, Stuart Barnes and Liam Toland, and analysis from Keith Wood, Matt Williams and Peter Stringer.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The first stage of this year's three-part Six Chair Challenge arrives, in which judges Simon Cowell, Rita Ora, Nick Grimshaw and Cheryl Fernandez-Versini are given the opportunity to pick six acts to champion through to the later stages of the contest. The format has the potential to generate a great deal of drama in the studio, as the judges have the right to switch acts in and out of their line-up whenever they choose. Girl group 4th Power, 17-year-old singer Louisa Johnson and youth worker Monica Michael are among the would-be stars who have already secured a place in this round of the contest, but it remains to be seen whether any of them will be able to win over the panel and progress further.</desc>

The format has the potential to generate a great deal of drama in the studio, as the judges have the right to switch acts in and out of their line-up whenever they choose. Girl group 4th Power, 17-year-old singer Louisa Johnson and youth worker Monica Michael are among the would-be stars who have already secured a place in this round of the contest, but it remains to be seen whether any of them will be able to win over the panel and progress further</desc>

He includes personal events - such as his sister's death from cancer - to explain how his view of how the world worked gradually changed. And he uses scientific research from a vast number of different sources to demonstrate how heatwaves, hurricanes and increasing water levels are a very real possibility  and that how, with forthright action, they can be avoided.

Disney comedy sequel, desperately trying to milk more mileage out of the first film's one-joke premise. Rick Moranis, Marcia Strassman, Robert Oliveri and Lloyd Bridges star. Incredibly, another sequel was to follow in 1997</desc>

Out of the upheaval and chaos came the gradual development of a wealthy, independent England, which many would recognise today in areas of language, law, religion and economy.</desc>
